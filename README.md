## Anagram Grouping Program

This project reads a list of words from a text file and groups them into sets of anagrams.  
For example, the words `listen`, `silent`, and `enlist` will be grouped together.

---

- **`Anagram.java`** – main program logic for grouping anagrams.
- **`anagrams.txt`** – input file containing words (one per line).

## Requirements

- Java **17+**
- Maven **4.0+**
- IntelliJ IDEA (optional, but recommended)

#### 2. Add words to *src/main/resources/anagrams.txt* or default will be used
